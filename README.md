# Predictive Modeling: Decision Trees on Supermarket Organic Products Dataset using SAS Enterprise Miner

The supermarket’s management wants to determine which customers are likely to purchase these products.
Also We will be modeling the data using decision trees to check which variables are most important for a customer who is buying ORGANIC PRODUCTS from the Supermarket.

• The objective of the project was to use Decision tree analysis to easily compare different courses of action against each other and evaluate the Consumer Behavior while purchasing the ORGANIC PRODUCTS from the Supermarket.

• We used SAS Enterprise Miner to clean and transform the data and finally create the Decision Trees.

• Using the dataset we have implemented two decision tree models in SAS Enterprise Miner and compared these two decision trees in the end to see which one performs better.

# Application: 
This analysis helped in better understanding the customer's decision making based on their purchase behavior to increase the sales of certain selected products.

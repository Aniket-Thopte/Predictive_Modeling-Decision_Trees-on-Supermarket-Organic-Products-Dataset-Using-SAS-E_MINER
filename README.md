# Predictive Modeling: Decision Trees on Supermarket Organic Products Dataset using SAS Enterprise Miner

The supermarketâ€™s management wants to determine which customers are likely to purchase these products.
Also We will be modeling the data using decision trees to check which variables are most important for a customer who is buying ORGANIC PRODUCTS from the Supermarket.

Objective: Using the ORGANICS data fit two decision tree models in SAS Enterprise Miner.

We compare these two decision trees in the end to see which one performs better.
